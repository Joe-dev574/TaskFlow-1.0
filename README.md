## About

After 30 years at Weld Manufacturing Operations—where I thrived as a Weld Engineer and served as VP of Operations and Quality—I traded metal manufacturing for code. *TaskFlow 1.0* is my MVP, a nod to those roots: hands-on problem-solving fused with user-focused design. As a former SaaS user frustrated by clunky, costly tools—burdened by overhead that steals time and money, often both—I’m crafting something better: simple, effective, and export-ready—no bloat to manage the management—just pure flow. I’m 40 days from App Store launch as of April 2, 2025, blending decades of precision with modern iOS innovation.

## Features

- **Task Tracking**: Organize and manage tasks efficiently with intuitive CRUD operations—create, read, update, and delete with ease.
- **Important Dates Management**: Stay ahead of deadlines and key dates with clear, category-themed tracking.
- **Reporting and Metrics**: Generate detailed, exportable reports and metrics for actionable insights—data that empowers, not overwhelms.
- **SwiftUI Craftsmanship**: Polished UI with serif fonts and vibrant `itemCategory.color` theming (e.g., Dark Orange `#D74100`).
- **Lightweight Design**: No overhead—just simple, effective tools built for real users.
